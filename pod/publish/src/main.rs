///
/// # Distributed Publisher Main
///
/// This is the entry point for the **Publisher** side of a distributed, robust, high-throughput
/// actor pipeline. The publisher is responsible for generating data, serializing it, and
/// streaming it out over a high-performance Aeron channel to one or more subscribers.
///
/// ## System Overview
///
/// The publisher graph is composed of several robust actors, each running in its own thread,
/// connected by high-capacity channels. The pipeline is designed for maximum throughput,
/// reliability, and observability.
///
///
/// ```text
///   [HEARTBEAT]      [GENERATOR]
///        |                |
///        |                |
///        +-------+--------+
///                |
///           [SERIALIZE]
///                |
///         [STREAM BUNDLE]
///                |
///           [PUBLISH]
///                |
///           [AERON IPC]
/// ```
///
/// - **HEARTBEAT**: Generates periodic "beats" to pace the system.
/// - **GENERATOR**: Produces a high-rate stream of values, simulating a real data source.
/// - **SERIALIZE**: Batches and serializes values from both heartbeat and generator into a dual-channel stream (control + payload).
/// - **STREAM BUNDLE**: Holds two channels per stream: one for control (lengths), one for payload (bytes).
/// - **PUBLISH**: Streams the serialized data out to subscribers using Aeron (IPC or UDP).
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **High Throughput**: Channels and batches are sized for millions of messages per second.
/// - **Robustness**: Each actor is isolated and can recover from panics or failures.
/// - **Observability**: Telemetry, logging, and channel triggers provide deep insight into system health.
/// - **Distributed**: Output is streamed over Aeron, a high-performance messaging system.
///
/// ## Shutdown Barrier
///
/// The `.with_shutdown_barrier(2)` call ensures that the system will not fully shut down
/// until two independent shutdown signals are received. This is critical in distributed
/// systems to ensure that all data is flushed and all actors have completed their work
/// before the process exits. For example, one shutdown may come from the local graph,
/// and another from a remote subscriber or a control plane.
///
/// ## Environment Setup
///
/// The telemetry server is configured to run on localhost:5551 for monitoring.
///

/// # Graph Construction
///
/// This function builds the full actor pipeline and connects all channels.
/// It demonstrates the robust architecture:
/// - Each actor is built with persistent state, enabling automatic restart and state recovery.
/// - Channels are created for each stage of the pipeline, with triggers for observability.
/// - Each actor is built as a SoloAct, running on its own thread for failure isolation.
/// - The final output is streamed over Aeron using a dual-channel (control + payload) bundle.
///
/// ## Channel Triggers and Telemetry
///
/// The channel builder is configured with triggers that monitor buffer fill levels:
/// - **Red Alert**: If the channel is >90% full, a red alert is triggered.
/// - **Orange Alert**: If the channel is >60% full, an orange alert is triggered.
/// - **Average Fill/Rate**: Telemetry is collected for average fill and message rate.
///
/// These triggers are essential for diagnosing backpressure and tuning performance.
